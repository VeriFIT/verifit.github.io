**VeriFIT** is a group including researchers and students from FIT BUT interested in research on methods of **automated analysis and verification** of systems. The interests of the group include *formal analysis and verification* (static analysis, abstract interpretation, model checking), *dynamic analysis* (i.e., analysis at run-time), intelligent testing as well as methods of *self-healing* of systems. The group is involved in basic research in the described areas as well as in development and evaluation of prototype verification tools.

# Research interests
Static analysis, dynamic analysis and testing of computer systems, software quality assurance, and related subjects from the areas of automata theory and logics, including:
* Static analysis and verification with formal roots in the area of infinite-state systems (programs with pointers and dynamic linked data structures, concurrent programs with unbounded concurrency, programs with unbounded integer variables, arrays, parameters, recursion, unbounded communication channels, etc.), building on applications of theory of automata, logics, and graphs.
* Testing and dynamic analysis of (esp. concurrent) software using a broad range of techniques (such as noise injection, extrapolation, data mining, machine learning), including possible self-healing or providing information for software quality assurance.
* Formal verification in the area of hardware design based on high-level hardware description languages.
* Research on efficient techniques of handling automata (e.g., simulation reduction of non-deterministic automata or efficient inclusion checking on non-deterministic automata), decision procedures for various logics, etc.
